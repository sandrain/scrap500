### scrap500

scrap500 collects available data from the Top500 website. This is rather
unreliable due to the unnormalized nature in the Top500 dataset.  This was used
for collecting datasets for the following papers:

* Awais Khan, Hyogi Sim, Sudharshan S. Vazhkudai, Ali R. Butt, and Youngjae Kim,
["An Analysis of System Balance and Architectural Trends Based on Top500 Supercomputers,"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3432261.3432263)
in The International Conference on High Performance Computing
in Asia-Pacific Region, New York, NY, USA, 2021, pp. 11â€“22.
* Hyogi Sim, Awais Khan, and Sudharshan S. Vazhkudai,
["An Analysis of System Balance and Architectural Trends Based on Top500 Supercomputers,"](https://doi.org/10.2172/1649132)
Oak Ridge Natinal Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, ORNL/TM-2020/1561, Aug. 2020.
